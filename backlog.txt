Everywhere:
- --covert filenames to titles--
- --icon--

List view:
- --swipe down to reload--
- --load more on scroll down--
- --new note button--
- --some notes have their text centered--
- --when list is empty, show "Nothing found"--
- --show error if cannot load--
- let items expand??
- try extracting first 5 lines and rendering as markdown??

Page view:
- --convert to markdown--
- --render markdown--

- Saving note with a different title is now requesting outdated note (maybe issue with cache)

- --save existing note, and rename if needed--
- --show error if cannot save--
- --saving note should update the filename in the list--

Search:
- --when submitted, re-load with filter--
- --when canceling new note creation, should get back to filtered list (see what's done with page view saved state)--
- --app bar does not show the search string after the search is done--
- --search bar does not pick the current search string either--

Delete note:
- TODO:

Optimizations:
- --load all notes in a batch in parallel--
- --preload notes that are most likely to be loaded soon--
- --cache get files result until reload--
- The spinner is still spinning for way too long
